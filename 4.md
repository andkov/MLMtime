### Report Due

**Assignment** Produce a dynamic report analyzing the performance of four (4) models:
  1. Empty WP model with random intercept
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1  + ( 1 | PersonID))
  ```
  
  2. WP model with random intercept and fixed effect of linear time
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 | PersonID))
  ```
  
  3. WP model with random intercept and random effect of linear time
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 + time | PersonID))
  ``` 
  4. WP model with fixed intercept and random effect of linear time
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( -1 + time | PersonID))
  ```
