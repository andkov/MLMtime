### Mplus 

Today we'll take a closer look at three models, identified in the book by equations (5.1), (5.3), and (5.5). 


The files needed for today's demonstration are located in the [master branch](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/tree/master) of the class's repository on GitHub. You may [download the entire repo](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/archive/master.zip) ( but MAKE SURE TO UNZIP IT BEFORE working from it) or download files individually from [./Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/tree/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5) on GitHub.

#### Files of interest:
 
  - [Ch5_Mplus.pdf](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/Ch5_Mplus.pdf) is today's slides  
  - [ELSA_LONG_n1000.dat](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/ELSA_LONG_n1000.dat) is a subsample of [English Longitudinal Study of Ageing](http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/)  
  - [ELSA_MLMGROWTH_EMPTY.inp](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/ELSA_MLMGROWTH_EMPTY.inp) is the MPlus input file we will use as the starting point.

##Friday Session

Please follow these instructions to prepare the desktop for the lab:
Read all the instructions first, then implement step by step.

1. Within **Firefox browser** right-click on [this link](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/archive/master.zip), choose "Save Link As" and save to your desktop.

2. After making sure that no such folder exist, unzip the downloaded archive on your desktop.

3. Open the folder "/psy564-master" **AND NOT THE ZIPPED ARCHIVE** 

4. Double-click on "psy564.Rproj" file to open RStudio. You are now ready.

5. Follow the [link](http://miktex.org/download) install MiXTex on you computer. It may take a few mins.

### Report Due

*Details will be provided in class*   

[a place to start with lmer](http://www.r-bloggers.com/random-regression-coefficients-using-lme4/)

**Assignment** Using provided [data]() produce a dynamic report analyzing the performance of three (3)  within-person models:

  (1) Empty WP model with random intercept  
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1  + ( 1 | PersonID))
  ```
  
  (2) WP model with random intercept and fixed effect of linear time  
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 | PersonID))
  ```
  
  (3) WP model with random intercept and random effect of linear time  
  ```
  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 + time | PersonID))
  ```
