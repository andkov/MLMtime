Integrating Mplus and R
----

## Plotting using GH5 files

The official jumping board into plotting GH5 is at [www.statmodel.com/mplus-R](http://www.statmodel.com/mplus-R/)

Plots can be created in R using the GH5 files generated by Mplus and containing plot information. See [description of GH5 files](http://statmodel2.com/mplus-R/GH5_R.shtml).

Functions that extract the needed information are stored in a separate script [mplus.R](http://www.statmodel.com/mplus-R/mplus.R)

The R package that works with HDF5 (data format in which GH5 are stored) is [rhdf5](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rhdf5/inst/doc/rhdf5.pdf)
