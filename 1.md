# Friday Session: Jan 9, 2015

## Mplus on UVic server

Establish VPN connection to [vpn1.uvic.ca](http://vpn1.uvic.ca) using your **netlink id** and password. Use Remote Desktop Connection to get access to the mplus.uvic.ca server. ( *Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Remote Desktop Connection* )     

**Please note**: When you open Remote Desktop Connection, click on the Local Resources tab and under “Local devices and resources”, click *More* and be sure that *drives* is checked. This will allow you to analyze your local computer data on the Mplus server and will save all of your scripts locally.  

(re)view slides on [Introduction to Mplus statistical software and command language](weeks/01/Introduction to Mplus statistical software and command language.pdf).


## Dynamic Documents with RStudio

### The working metaphor

Scientists are **data journalists** who tell stories of their data.     
They type text to instruct a *human* reader how to recreate the story in his/her mind.  
They type text to instruct a *computer* how to manipulate data, evaluate models, print graphs, and  assemble output.   

**Documents** that contain typed instructions for both human and computer consumption that recreate a story about the data are called **DYNAMIC**.

See an example of a dynamic document in this [markdown simulator](https://demo.ocpu.io/markdownapp/www/), created in javascript by  [Jeroen Ooms](http://jeroenooms.github.io/). 

**markdown** language uses special combinations of characters to make text strings appear differently: in bold, italics, as a heading, or as a name of the column in the table. This language is very simple and straightforward, but may take a little bit to get used to. To help you get proficient with markdown consider some of the following resources.  

- [markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) : a well-written "breaking into" guide. Gives ample verbal description. Recommended for newbies. By John Gruber.  
- [markdown cheat-sheet](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) : brief, simple, parallel view of what the code is doing.By Mashery group.   
- [markdown in R](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.ca/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) : a blog entry on getting started with **rmarkdown** - a version of markdown enhanced for the use with RStudio.  By Jeromy Anglim.


You will need markdown to complete homework assignments and we won't spend any dedicated lab time on it, so please, pick it up on your own. 


### Goals in Data Science projects
Adapting reproducible research standards, each project in data science could be conceptualized as having the following objectives:  

- **Strategic Goal**   
Tell a *story about your data*. 

- **Tactical Goal**  
Develop, evaluate, and interpret statistical models with which you tell a *story about your data*.

- **Technical Assignment**  
Write a computer script that generates an electronic document reporting the statistical models with which you tell a *story about your data*.

### Learning R 

[A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/) - The RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it. In fact, do it right now. 

Now we'll use one of the resources mentioned in the link above, [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html).  
Open your RStudio and execute the following code:  

```
install.packages("swirl")  
install.packages("Rtools")  
install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github(c("swirldev/swirl", "swirldev/swirlify"))  
library(swirlify)  
```

Follow the prompt and complete the first lesson.

I also recommend completing two free interactive courses at DataCamp: [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) and [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp). Their content partially overlaps with the training by two available courses by [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) package, but gives a different take and examples. 


### More Resources
 - for brief reviews of key books and resources see Will Beasley's [Resources Opinions](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/RedcapExamplesAndPatterns/blob/master/DocumentationGlobal/ResourcesOpinions.md)
 - another presentation by Will provides an excellent overview of [Statistical Collaboration with GitHub](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/master/2014_Presentations/05_May/BeasleyScugGitHub2014-05.html#/)
 - Winston Chan's [R Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do) is a perfect book to get you started with producing graphs with RStudio
 - [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - thorough and convenient resource for R reference


## Reports and Activities

### REPORTS
 - 10 reports 10 points each  
 - Submit electronically to andkov and smhofer at uvic dot ca. Consult [submission instruction]() and [naming convention]()

**Rosetta Stone.** A question, a series of questions, or other activity that involves learning some programming language or comparing programming languages.

The activities for the other 4 class participation points will be **wildcards** - you will not know what they will be ahead of time to keep things interesting. Examples: output interpretation. 


## iClicker training

We will cover the basic functionality of iClickers for polling during class. Please read [iClicker training guide](http://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/learningteaching/iclicker/) for further details.

## What to prepare for next time
- read Chapter 2    
- do as many R tutorial with DataCamp and swirl as possible    
- complete pre-class activities (before 10:30 am Tuesday)  
- review MPlus introduction slides
