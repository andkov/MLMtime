Lab: dynamic reporting\n---\n\n----\n**Admission requirements** *What you need to read before coming to class on Tuesday* [.](https://github.com/andkov/MLMtime/edit/gh-pages/4.md)\n\n**Chapter**: *5 - INTRODUCTION TO RANDOM EFFECTS OF TIME AND MODEL ESTIMATION* \n\n**Lecture**: *Introduction to Random Effects of Time and Model Estimation*  [slides](http://www.lesahoffman.com/944/944_Lecture05_Random_Effects.pdf) |  [watch parts 1,2, and 3 of Lecture 5](http://www.lesahoffman.com/944/index.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- \n\n\n### Mplus \n\nToday we'll take a closer look at three models, identified in the book by equations (5.1), (5.3), and (5.5). \n\n\nThe files needed for today's demonstration are located in the [master branch](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/tree/master) of the class's repository on GitHub. You may [download the entire repo](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/archive/master.zip) ( but MAKE SURE TO UNZIP IT BEFORE working from it) or download files individually from [./Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/tree/master/Chapters/05/Class_Chapter5) on GitHub.\n\n#### Files of interest:\n \n  - [Ch5_Mplus.pdf](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/Ch5_Mplus.pdf) is today's slides  \n  - [ELSA_LONG_n1000.dat](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/ELSA_LONG_n1000.dat) is a subsample of [English Longitudinal Study of Ageing](http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/)  \n  - [ELSA_MLMGROWTH_EMPTY.inp](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/05/MPlus_Chapter5/ELSA_MLMGROWTH_EMPTY.inp) is the MPlus input file we will use as the starting point. \n  \n\n---- \n\n### Report Due\n\n*Details will be provided in class*   \n\n**Assignment** Using provided [data]() produce a dynamic report analyzing the performance of three (3)  within-person models:\n\n  (1) Empty WP model with random intercept  \n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1  + ( 1 | PersonID))\n  ```\n  \n  (2) WP model with random intercept and fixed effect of linear time  \n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 | PersonID))\n  ```\n  \n  (3) WP model with random intercept and random effect of linear time  \n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 + time | PersonID))\n  ``` \n",
