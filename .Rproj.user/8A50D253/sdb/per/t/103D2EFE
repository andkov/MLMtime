(2014,  Longitudinal Analysis: Modeling Within-Person Variation and Change)   \n\nVersion 6 Mplus User’s Guide.  www.statmodel.com\n\n## Course Description\n\nThis course will provide an overview of current statistical approaches for the analysis of variation and change. Conceptual and research design issues will be discussed throughout with an emphasis on alternative models for explaining and predicting individual-level change. Hands-on training in analysis of longitudinal data will focus on use of Mplus (www.statmodel.com), a statistical program that has many features of both traditional MLM and SEM approaches. A variety of models will be examined and applied to actual data including models with time invariant and time-varying covariates, factor-level outcomes, alternative time structures, and joint models of variation and change. Substantive examples will be used throughout the course based on published and unpublished results from several major longitudinal studies on developmental and aging-related change.  \n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis is an advanced course on research methodology and statistical analysis. Students should have familiarity with multivariate statistical methods (e.g., multiple regression, factor analysis). Experience with Mplus is not expected. Please contact the instructor if you have questions about these prerequisites.\n\n## Course Requirements\n\nThe format of the course will be part lecture and part in-class computer application. Course evaluation will be based on the ability to independently analyze data, correctly interpret model estimates, and effectively communicate and discuss results. The assignments are designed to provide experience with model conception and specification, evaluation of model fit and nested models, interpretation of results, and communication of research findings. A final project will be based on data that you are currently working with (or data made available for this purpose).\n\nThe University of Victoria manages a statistical server with 25 Mplus licenses available for faculty and student use. In addition, each of you will be identified with a particular license that will permit you to have direct consulting with the Muthen’s should this be of use during or after the course. If you are interested in this course and using Mplus, please familiarize yourself with the Mplus website as it contains many features that will be useful to you (www.statmodel.com). \n\n## Evaluation and Grading Policy\n\nYour grade will be based on four type of assessments:  \n\nassessment | date | total points | notes  \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nQuiz | daily | 10 | each quiz counts as .5 pts    \nProjects | ~ weekly | 60 | best 6 out of 8, 10 pts each    \nMidterm | due Feb 13, 23:59 | 15 | guided literature review   \nFinal | due Apr 3, 23:59 | 15 | independent model extention  \n\nThe final letter grade in the course will be based on total percent score rounded to the third decimal point as shown:    \n\nA+   =    [90 , 100]     \t \nA    =  \t[85 , 89]\t  \nA-   =  \t[80 , 84]\t  \nB+\t =  \t[77 , 79]  \nB    =  \t[73 , 76]  \nB-   =\t  [70 , 72 ] \t\nC+\t =\t  [65 ,69]\t  \nC    =\t  [60 , 64]  \nD    =  \t[50 , 59]\t  \nF\t   = \t  [0 , 49]  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
