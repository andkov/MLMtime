Conceptual and research design issues will be discussed throughout with an emphasis on alternative models for explaining and predicting individual-level change. Hands-on training in analysis of longitudinal data will focus on use of Mplus (www.statmodel.com), a statistical program that has many features of both traditional MLM and SEM approaches. A variety of models will be examined and applied to actual data including models with time invariant and time-varying covariates, factor-level outcomes, alternative time structures, and joint models of variation and change. Substantive examples will be used throughout the course based on published and unpublished results from several major longitudinal studies on developmental and aging-related change.  \n\n\n",
