Empty WP model with random intercept\n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1  + ( 1 | PersonID))\n  ```\n  \n  2. WP model with random intercept and fixed effect of linear time\n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 | PersonID))\n  ```\n  \n  3. WP model with random intercept and random effect of linear time\n  ```\n  lmer(y ~ 1 + time + ( 1 + time | PersonID))\n  ``` \n  4.
