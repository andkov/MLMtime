## Description

This course will provide an overview of current statistical approaches for the analysis of variation and change. Conceptual and research design issues will be discussed throughout with an emphasis on alternative models for explaining and predicting individual-level change. Hands-on training in analysis of longitudinal data will focus on use of Mplus, SAS, and R  a statistical program that has many features of both traditional MLM and SEM approaches. A variety of models will be examined and applied to actual data including models with time invariant and time-varying covariates, factor-level outcomes, alternative time structures, and joint models of variation and change. Substantive examples will be used throughout the course based on published and unpublished results from several major longitudinal studies on developmental and aging-related change.  

## Organization and Philosophy




Week  | Session | Topic  | Must Read | Resources 
------|---------|--------|-----------|----------



## Prerequisites

This is an advanced course on research methodology and statistical analysis. Students should have familiarity with multivariate statistical methods (e.g., multiple regression, factor analysis). Experience with Mplus, SAS, or R is beneficial, but not expected. Please contact the instructor if you have questions about these prerequisites.

## Software

**SAS**   - Support for SAS

**Mplus** The University of Victoria manages a statistical server with 25 Mplus licenses available for faculty and student use. In addition, each of you will be identified with a particular license that will permit you to have direct consulting with the Muthen’s should this be of use during or after the course. If you are interested in this course and using Mplus, please familiarize yourself with the Mplus website as it contains many features that will be useful to you (www.statmodel.com). 

**R**  - support for R

## Evaluation and Grading Policy

Course evaluation will be based on the ability to independently analyze data, correctly interpret model estimates, and effectively communicate and discuss results. The assignments are designed to provide experience with model conception and specification, evaluation of model fit and nested models, interpretation of results, and communication of research findings.

Your grade will be based on four type of assessments:  

assessment | date | total points | notes  
--- | --- | --- | ---
Quiz | daily | 10 | each quiz counts as .5 pts    
Projects | ~ weekly | 60 | best 6 out of 8, 10 pts each    
Midterm | due Feb 13, 23:59 | 15 | guided literature review   
Final | due Apr 3, 23:59 | 15 | independent model extention  

The final letter grade in the course will be based on total percent score rounded to the third decimal point as shown:    

A+   =    [90 , 100]     	 
A    =  	[85 , 89]	  
A-   =  	[80 , 84]	  
B+	 =  	[77 , 79]  
B    =  	[73 , 76]  
B-   =	  [70 , 72 ] 	
C+	 =	  [65 ,69]	  
C    =	  [60 , 64]  
D    =  	[50 , 59]	  
F	   = 	  [0 , 49]  




## Important Course Policy Information  

### Commitment to Inclusivity and Diversity

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing and protecting a positive and supportive and safe learning and working environment for all its members.  

### Academic Integrity 

The Department of Psychology fully endorses and intends to enforce rigorously the [Senate Policy on Academic integrity](http://web.uvic.ca/calendar2011/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html)(p. 33-34, UVic Calendar 2014-15).  It is of utmost importance that students who do their work honestly be protected from those who do not.  Because this policy is in place to ensure that students carry out and benefit from the learning activities assigned in each course, it is expected that students will cooperate in its implementation.

*The offences defined by the policy can be summarized briefly as follows*:  

1.  **Plagiarism**. You must make sure that the work you submit is your work and not someone else’s.  There are proper procedures for citing the works of others.  The student is responsible for being aware of and using these procedures.  
2.	**Multiple Submission**.  Only under exceptional circumstances may a work submitted to fulfill an academic requirement be used to satisfy another similar requirement. The student is responsible for clarifying this with the instructor(s) involved.    
3.	**Falsifying Materials Subject to Academic Evaluation**.  This includes falsification of data, use of commercially prepared essays, using information from the Internet without proper citation, citing sources from which material is not actually obtained, etc.  
4.	**Cheating on Assignments, Tests, and Examinations**.  You may not copy the work of others in or out of class; you may not give your work to others for the purpose of copying; you may not use unauthorized material or equipment during examinations or tests; and you may not impersonate or allow yourself to be impersonated by another at an examination. The Department of Psychology has a policy of not making old examinations available for study purposes.  Therefore, use of old exams without the express written permission of the instructor constitutes cheating by the user, and abetting of cheating by the person who provided the exam.  
5.	**Being an Accessory to Offences**.  This means that helping another student to cheat (for instance, by showing or communicating to them answers to an assignment, or by allowing them to view answers on an exam) is an academic offence.
