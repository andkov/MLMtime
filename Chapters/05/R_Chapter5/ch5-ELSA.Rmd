# Data prep

 Today we will look at the data example from chapter 5 of [Longitudinal Analysis](http://www.pilesofvariance.com/) by Lesa Hoffman. You will find all the necessary files at

```
 ./Chapters/05/R_Chapter5/
```
 after you [download and unzip](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/archive/master.zip) the folder of this repository.

```
 ./Chapters/05/R_Chapter5/hoffman-ch5.R
```
 contains code that conducts the analysis and 
   
```
 ./Chapters/03/R_Chapter3/hoffman-ch5.Rmd
```
contains the [report](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/03/R_Chapter3/hoffman-ch3.html). Html file must be compiled before it can be viewed. You can view .html files stored on GitHub.com by pasting their url address into [HTMLpreviewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?)

#### Working files
 - [hoffman-ch5.R](https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/03/R_Chapter3/hoffman-ch3.R) contains the script that replicates **example 3a** from Chapter 3 of [Longitudinal Analysis](http://www.pilesofvariance.com/) by Lesa Hoffman. We fit empty between-person (3.1) and empty within-person (3.2) models to the supplied dataset containing 2 measures for 50 subjects.
 - [hoffman-ch5.Rmd](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andkov/psy564/blob/master/Chapters/03/R_Chapter3/hoffman-ch3.html) contains annotations to what happens in <code>hoffman-ch5.R</code> script. HTML is "knitted" in RStudio by knitr package by combining .R and .Rmd files: explainations for computer and for humans, respectively.  This report is a self-contained account of two statistical models.

## Data input

Before asking R to perform operations (functions), we load the packages which contain the definitions of these functions. 
```{r LoadPackages, warning=F,message=F}

```

We would like to import data the data file

```
SAS_Chapter5.sas7bdat
```

located at 

```
./Chapters/05/SAS_Chapter5/
```

of your repository. 

```{r LoadData}

```


## Data inspection

We'd like to inspect the data object we've just imported. Doulbe-click the icon of the dataset in the Environment tab of RStudio or use 
```
View(ds)
```
A few basic function calls give us a quick look ath the object *ds0* - our "ground zero" in the chain of data transformations
```{r BasicDescriptive}

```


## Wide to Long

Our data were in a long format, with each level of the variable *wave* recorded in a single column 
```{r}
head(ds0)
```

No other transformation is necessary. 
```{r StackData}

```
Suffix "L" in "dsL" signifies that the data is in the **L**ong format.

## Data tweaking

Data didn't require any tweaking.
```{r TweakLong}

```
Suffix "M" in "dsM" signifies that the data is ready for  **M**odeling

# Graphing

To better understand the patterns we visualize the data with a simple line plot
```{r GraphingData0}

```

To make the graph more readable and informative we customize it with a set of presets collected in a ggplot theme
```{r LoadGraphThemes}

```

and add customizations relevant to current scenario

```{r GraphingData1}

```

black lines give us a longitudinal perspective on the data, depicting the observed trajectories of individuals. To juxtapose is with cross-sectional perspective, we can add a different geom, styled to contrast the difference 

```{r GraphingData2}

```



# Modeling 

## 3.1
The baseline for the models to follow is the empty between-person model with no predictors


$\begin{array}{l}
{y_{ti}} = {\beta _{0i}} + {\varepsilon _{ti}}\\
{\beta _{0i}} = {\gamma _{00}}\\
{}\\
{y_{ti}} = {\gamma _{00}} + {\varepsilon _{ti}}
\end{array}$


### Run m3.1
```{r RunM3_1}

```

### Inspect m3.1
```{r InspectM3_1}

```

### Graph m3.1
```{r GraphM3_1, echo=echoChunks, warning=warningChunks, out.width=outwidthChunks}

```

### Full Spec m3.1
![graph m3.1](./images/m3.1.JPG)

## 5.1 

Now we'd like to see how this basic model prediction will change when we compute a **U**nique intercept for each person

$\begin{array}{l}
{y_{ti}} = {\beta _{0i}} + {\varepsilon _{ti}}\\
{\beta _{0i}} = {\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}\\
{}\\
{y_{ti}} = ({\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}) + {\varepsilon _{ti}}
\end{array}$

### Run m5.1
```{r RunM5_1}

```

### Inspect m5.1
```{r InspectM5_1}

```

### Graph m5.1
```{r GraphM5_1, echo=echoChunks, warning=warningChunks, out.width=outwidthChunks}

```

### Full Spec m5.1
![graph m5.1](./images/m5.1.JPG)

## 5.3

The first predictor we will enter into our model is the fixed effect of linear time

$\begin{array}{l}
{y_{ti}} = {\beta _{0i}} + {\beta _{1i}}TV{C_{1ti}} + {\varepsilon _{ti}}\\
{\beta _{0i}} = {\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}\\
{\beta _{1i}} = {\gamma _{10}}\\
{}\\
{y_{ti}} = ({\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}) + {\gamma _{10}}(TV{C_{1ti}}) + {\varepsilon _{ti}}
\end{array}$


### Run m5.3
```{r RunM5_3}

```

### Inspect m5.3
```{r InspectM5_3}

```

### Graph m5.3
```{r GraphM5_3, echo=echoChunks, warning=warningChunks, out.width=outwidthChunks}

```

### Full Spec m5.3
![graph m5.3](./images/m5.3.JPG)

## 5.5

Now would like to compute a unique linear slope for each individual

$\begin{array}{l}
{y_{ti}} = {\beta _{0i}} + {\beta _{1i}}TV{C_{1ti}} + {\varepsilon _{ti}}\\
{\beta _{0i}} = {\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}\\
{\beta _{1i}} = {\gamma _{10}} + {u_{1i}}\\
{}\\
{y_{ti}} = ({\gamma _{00}} + {u_{0i}}) + ({\gamma _{10}} + {u_{1i}})(TV{C_{1ti}}) + {\varepsilon _{ti}}
\end{array}$

### Run m5.5
```{r RunM5_5}

```

### Inspect m5.5
```{r InspectM5_5}

```

### Graph m5.5
```{r GraphM5_5, echo=echoChunks, warning=warningChunks, out.width=outwidthChunks}

```

### Full Spec m5.5
![graph m5.5](./images/m5.5.JPG)
